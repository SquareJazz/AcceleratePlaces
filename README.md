## About Us
At Accelerate Places, we believe that a business needs more than just a great building. 
As part of the UKâ€™s leading venture builder, we have over 18 years experience helping businesses grow. Our co-working hubs provide your business with unique event space, a connected community, and a place for your company to grow in a collaborative environment.

## The Challenge
Alone we are smart, together we are brilliant.

Most residents in the Manchester co-working space don't know who is here, what skills they have, or what services businesses based here offer - if they did, more collaboration could be happening!

We want you to help us improve collaboration between companies, freelancers & event hosts.

Note: We already have a Slack group for the office.
